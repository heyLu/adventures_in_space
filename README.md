# Adventures in space

We're not so adventurous right now, sorry. More to come soonish.

## A little bit of context

This is a student project by two students of the [HTWK Leipzig][] for a
*Multimedia Web-Applications* course. It will be implemented using
[OpenLaszlo][] on the clients (hopefully, there will be a HTML5 backend,
too) and a Java server for all calculations and bookkeeping.

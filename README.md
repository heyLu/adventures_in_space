# Adventures in space

It's the year 2626. After the robot uprising of 2090 and humanities
inevitable defeat, a few human survivors fled to the stars. Even
though their ingenuity saved their lives they could not change the
laws of physics. Now, 500 years later, still on their way to Proxima Centauri
and its neighboring stars, the fugitives fight with their last remaining
resources against each other for an unlikely future. A fight in which,
to prevent history repeating itself, no computer understanding higher
math could have any part in.

Now it is your turn to defend your ship and to ensure the survival
of your clan, fighting against those who you once called friends.

## A little bit of context

This is a student project by two students of the [HTWK Leipzig][] for a
*Multimedia Web-Applications* course. It will be implemented using
[OpenLaszlo][] on the clients (<del>hopefully, there will be a HTML5 backend,
too</del> actually, we did the HTML interface first) and a Java server
for all calculations and bookkeeping.
